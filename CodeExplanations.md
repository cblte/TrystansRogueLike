This file tries to explain some concepts used in the game.

## PlayScreen - ViewPort with `getScrollX` and `getScrollY`

These methods determine the scroll position of the viewport within the game world, given the center point of the
viewport (centerX and centerY) and the size of the viewport (screenWidth and screenHeight). The scroll position is
calculated so that the viewport is centered on the center point, while still staying within the bounds of the game
world.

For example, the getScrollX() method returns the X coordinate of the top-left corner of the viewport. The value is
calculated by taking the center point (centerX) and subtracting half of the viewport width (screenWidth / 2). This
centers the viewport horizontally on the center point. However, this value may cause the viewport to go outside the game
world boundaries. Therefore, the Math.max() and Math.min() methods are used to clamp the value between 0 (the left edge
of the game world) and world.width() - screenWidth (the right edge of the game world, adjusted for the viewport width).

Similarly, the getScrollY() method returns the Y coordinate of the top-left corner of the viewport, with similar
calculations and clamping.

Overall, these methods are a common way to determine the scroll position of a viewport in a game world with limited
screen real estate, and help to keep the player centered and oriented within the game world.
